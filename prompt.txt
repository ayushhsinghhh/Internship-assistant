Email 1:
Subject: AI-Powered Product Decisions at Scale

Hi Productboard AI Team,

I came across Productboard's AI capabilities and was impressed by your vision to transform product management practices through AI-driven insights. I'd love to be considered for the AI Intern position, as my skills and experience closely align with your goals.

My recent work on a generative AI-powered legal document generator using LangChain and Neo4j, achieving a BLEU score of 53, has given me hands-on experience in designing and optimizing AI workflows for real-world applications. I've also utilized prompt engineering, graph retrieval-augmented generation, and text indexing to improve semantic search efficiency, which I believe would be valuable in Productboard's mission to empower customers with data-driven insights.

I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to your AI team, particularly in exploring new concepts, experimenting with different LLMs, and improving current features like summarization and sentiment detection. My proficiency in Python, data preprocessing, and practical background in data science and LLMs make me a strong fit for this role.

I'm drawn to Productboard's customer-centric approach and commitment to creating a work environment where people feel empowered, supported, and included. I'd love to discuss how my skills can help drive impactful product decisions at scale.

I've attached my resume for your review. Please let me know if you need anything else.

Warm regards, Ayush Singh | +91 9305010425

Email 2:
Hi [Name],

I‚Äôve been following Productboard‚Äôs journey, and I‚Äôm genuinely impressed by how you're transforming product management using AI. Your work on building copilot features, clustering insights, and integrating LLMs into core workflows strongly aligns with my background.

At IIT Indore, I‚Äôve led projects involving LangChain, LangGraph, and prompt engineering for legal AI tools, and recently fine-tuned LLaMA-3 for a multilingual ad-generation model using ORPO. My experience spans across real-time systems, semantic embeddings with Neo4j, and streamlining ML pipelines‚Äîskills I‚Äôd be excited to bring to your AI team. I‚Äôm especially drawn to the scale and impact of the agentic infrastructure you're building.

I‚Äôd love to have a quick chat to explore how I can contribute to Productboard and build something meaningful together. I‚Äôm happy to work in hybrid mode or relocate to Prague if the internship converts into a full-time opportunity.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Warm regards,
Ayush Singh
which is better and why:
Better Email: Email 2
Why Email 2 is Stronger:
Tone & Personalization

It sounds more human and conversational while still being professional.

Mentions specific projects and initiatives at Productboard (copilot features, clustering insights, agentic infrastructure), which shows you're familiar with the company's work‚Äîthis signals genuine interest.

Stronger Technical Credibility

You reference cutting-edge work like fine-tuning LLaMA-3, ORPO, LangGraph, and multilingual ad-generation, which adds more technical depth than Email 1.

These keywords indicate you‚Äôre at the forefront of current AI developments, which gives confidence in your technical competence.

Clear Intent & Flexibility

You ask for a quick chat, which is a softer CTA than asking to be ‚Äúconsidered‚Äù‚Äîit encourages a response.

Offering relocation/hybrid shows you're flexible and serious about long-term commitment.

üìâ Email 1: What It Gets Right and Where It Falls Short
Strengths:
It's well-written, clear, and has a structured pitch.

Mentions solid achievements (BLEU score, semantic search, etc.).

Shows awareness of Productboard‚Äôs mission and values.

Drawbacks:
Feels more generic and slightly formal.

Lacks the same level of personalization and excitement.

Doesn‚Äôt highlight as many high-level technical buzzwords or contributions.

The CTA (‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to be considered‚Ä¶‚Äù) is a bit passive.

üëâ Suggested Tweaks for Email 2 (to make it even stronger):
You might slightly polish the opening to increase clarity:

"I‚Äôve been following Productboard‚Äôs journey and am genuinely impressed by your use of AI to transform product management. Your work on copilot features, clustering insights, and integrating LLMs into core workflows strongly aligns with my experience."

Also, consider attaching the resume in the second email and mentioning it explicitly, just like you did in Email 1:

"I‚Äôve attached my resume for your review‚Äîhappy to provide more details or code samples if needed."

‚úÖ Final Verdict: Use Email 2, with light edits
It‚Äôs more compelling, technically impressive, and personally engaging‚Äîideal for grabbing attention in a competitive AI internship space.
